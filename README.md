# HTML-and-CSS

This is the repository for my HTML and CSS projects

It contains several small HTML and CSS files, but has 2 main projects.

*One-Page Website

*Portfolio Project

*bootstrap4_project

The one page website is a website I made that was themed after Portal 2.

The portfolio project is a website I made to represent me,
and contains information and a contact form. 

Visit beeisland.github.io to view it.

The bootstrap4_project was made to teach me bootstrap, 
and is an informational website about the trees of the pacific northwest.
