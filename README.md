# HTML-and-CSS

This is the repository for my HTML and CSS projects

It contains several small HTML and CSS files, but has 2 main projects.

*One-Page Website

*Portfolio Project

The one page website is a website I made that was themed after Portal 2.

The portfolio project is a website I made to represent me,
and contains information and a contact form.
visit beeisland.github.io to view it.
